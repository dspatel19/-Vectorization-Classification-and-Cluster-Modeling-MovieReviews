DSP_Doc1_Us,"Writer-director Jordan Peele's 2017 Get Out was a brash and intriguing debut, a picture that wrestled with the notion of whether or not America can ever be a post-racial society: Vital and spooky, it refused to hand over easy answers. With the ambitious home-invasion horror chiller Us, Peele goes even deeper into the conflicted territory of class and race and privilege; he also ponders the traits that make us most human. But this time, he s got so many ideas he can barely corral them, let alone connect them. He overthinks himself into a corner, and we re stuck there with him. Lupita Nyong o stars as Adelaide, who has overcome a traumatic childhood experience and now has a family of her own, including husband Gabe (Winston Duke) and two kids: graceful, well-adjusted Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and the slightly more awkward Jason (Evan Alex), who wears a wolfman mask pushed up on his head as a kind of security blanket. We meet the comfortably middle-class Wilson family as they re heading off on vacation to Santa Cruz, the site of Adelaide s childhood ordeal. On their first night away, they look out and see a family of four, mute and stony echoes of themselves, standing in the driveway. From there, Peele unspools a story of  shadow  people, long forced to live underground but now streaming to the Earth s surface to claim, violently, what they feel is rightfully theirs. The effectiveness of Us may depend on how little you know about it going in, so the spoiler-averse may wish to stop reading here. But it s impossible to address any of the movie s larger ideas without giving away key plot points: Before long, that shadow family has infiltrated the house, and now that we can get a good look, we see that each of them is a not-quite-right replica of a Wilson, dressed in a red jumpsuit and wielding a pair of menacing-looking shears. At one point a terrified Adelaide asks the other mother, a twin of herself but with vacant, crazy eyes and a demented smile,  What are you people?   We are Americans,  the lookalike responds, in a whispery growl. That s a bright, neon-lit Author s Message if ever there was one, though the idea of using a group of sunlight-deprived semi-zombies as a metaphorical element in a parable about class complacency isn t necessarily a bad one. Are you and your family doing great? Do you live in a nice place, drive an expensive car, and have plenty of food for everyone to eat? Be grateful for it. But be aware that there are others who, through no fault of their own, don t live at the same comfort level or are, in fact, barely surviving. (The Wilsons also have close friends, Josh and Kitty, played by Tim Heidecker and Elisabeth Moss, who have more money and nicer stuff than they do, a source of irritation for Gabe in particular, and another of the movie s threads about class consciousness in America.) But Peele doesn t always lay out his ideas clearly. Us isn t always fun to watch; there are stretches where it s plodding and dour. He s overly fond of heavy-duty references, including Biblical ones: A creepy dude holds a sign that reads Jeremiah 11:11. (If you don t know it outright, it s the one that goes,  Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them. ) The mood of Us is sometimes chilling, but even then, you re not always sure what, exactly, is chilling you. Maybe it s just the feeling of being trapped in an over-air-conditioned lecture hall, because there s a strain of preachiness running through the whole thing. One thing that s unquestionable: Peele is a dazzling visual stylist. (Peele s cinematographer is Mike Gioulakis, who also shot David Robert Mitchell s It Follows, as well as M. Night Shyamalan s Split and Glass.) The movie s opening, which details young Adelaide s nightmare it takes place in a ghoulish hall of mirrors on the Santa Cruz boardwalk is a mini-horror masterpiece by itself, an evocation of the outright weirdness of childhood rather than its wonder: As the girl wanders away from her parents, in an almost trancelike state, she clutches a candied apple so shiny it s like blood-red crystal ball and puts us in a trance, too. Yet the rest of Us is laden with metaphors, and they pile up so quickly that not even Peele can keep up with them. The movie repeatedly references Hands Across America, a 1986 benefit event in which some 6.5 million people joined hands along a route mapped out across the contiguous United States. (Many participants had donated $10 to reserve a space in the chain; the money was donated to local charities dedicated to fighting hunger and ending poverty.) In Us, the shadow people form a similar chain. But it s hard to know what Peele is trying to say with that image. Are the semi-zombies of Us just less fortunate versions of us? Are they actually us and we don t know it? Is their clumsy anger somehow superior to thought and reason? After all, it has unified them, while we aboveground humans are more divided than ever. How, in the end, are we supposed to feel about these shadow people, for so long deprived of basic human rights including daylight that they have become murderous clones? Sometimes great movies are ambiguous, but ambiguity resulting from unclear thinking makes nothing great. It s one thing for a movie to humble you by leaving you unsure about yourself and your place in the world; it s another for it to leave you wondering what, exactly, a filmmaker is trying to use his formidable verbal and visual vocabulary to say."
DSP_Doc2_Us,"It s not ordinary. But certainly not extraordinary. Jordan Peele s follow-up to the box-office-smash Get Out doesn t expand the boundaries of the horror genre like its predecessor or A Quiet Place did. It s almost a retreat into norms that bring to mind humorous horror flicks like Scary Movie, zombie thrillers akin to Dawn of the Dead and over-produced shockers like The Shining. Remember the small, indie feel of Get Out? It s gone. Vanished like a ghost.  The Wilsons, an upper-middle-class family in Northern California, have just settled into their lakeside vacation home. They have arrived, physically and symbolically. Thirtysomething-year-old dad, Gabe (Winston Duke, Black Panther), his tween daughter Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and young son Jason (Evan Alex) all want to go to Santa Cruz Beach. It s got sand, sea, a boardwalk and an amusement park. What s not to like?   Mom, Adelaide (Lupita Nyong o, Twelve Years a Slave), is dead set against the visit. The thought brings back debilitating PTSD. Back in 1986, when she was a kid (Madison Curry) her parents (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II and Anna Diop) brought her to that same amusement park. She wandered off, got lost in an arcade called Vision Quest, and by the time they found her she was traumatized. So distressed, she couldn t speak and the couple sought therapy for her. A trip to Santa Cruz puts Adelaide in a cold sweat. But her family talks her into it and life is never the same afterwards.   For easy-to-please horror genre fans, who don t ask much from creepy movies, there are enough frights and shocks to satiate: Mirror-image intruders (aka The Tethered), scissors stabbing bodies, blunt force trauma, bodies falling off balconies, boating accidents, heads getting whacked with golf clubs  There are an abundance of thrills. The Wilson family is likable, modern, hip, African American and unapologetically class-conscious. The setting of Northern California and especially the beaches of Santa Cruz are quite inviting.   For discerning fans with a more sophisticated palate, Peele s script is using the doppelganger monsters as a metaphor. They represent the people left behind in the shadows, those who don t get a chance at the good life. The eerie folks from the netherworld who look like the protagonists become a weird head game that is an effective device, initially.  Credit Peele for a very creative and three-dimensional premise. The problem with his ambitious blueprint is that some viewers won t understand what he s after.   The dialogue is cool, especially Gabe s funny asides, but none of it is memorable. The main characters are likable, but not all that exceptional. Neither are their close friends the Tyler family, who act like empty-headed millennials. There is an initial shock when the Wilsons meet the family that trespasses on their property. The astonishment of them seeing themselves is icky at first, but that weird feeling subsides. Soon after, the footage drifts into very standard thriller aspects. Chase scenes, people handcuffed to furniture, combat on boats none of it stretches the imagination.   As action occurs, the cutting back-and-forth between scenes seems a bit clumsy. Sometimes it feels like you re watching a bunch of set pieces and not a group of bone-chilling kinetic sequences that flow with an electric energy. Peele s direction should get tighter, more desperate and exciting as the film progresses. Instead, it remains at a moderate tempo.   Editor Nicholas Monsour has experience with humorous movies (Keanu) and comic TV shows (Cobra Kai). His lack of a background in the horror or thriller genres is evidenced by his non-rhythmic pacing. Even as the film builds to its conclusion, the speed of action and length of scenes stays the same. No sense of real urgency arrives. Nada.  There are some plot holes: If Adelaide was so traumatized by Santa Cruz Beach, why does she go back?  And if she s going to return, and is really scared, why would she let her young son out of her sight? When you get to the end of the movie and figure out the game that is being played, her actions make even less sense. Sometimes the characters make irrational decisions and do stupid stuff.  The slow pacing leaves some dead time when the camera (Michael Gioulakis, Glass) languishes on the countryside and the musical score (Michael Abels, Get Out) blares with loud string music. That s when the film feels like the over-stuffed The Shining, heavy on the big buildup and shoddy on the action. The real people wear contemporary costumes that are fitting (costume design by Kym Barrett, The Matrix). The faux folks are stuck in dull red jumpsuits.  The film s prologue mentions thousands of tunnels that run underground in the U.S., like there is a dingy underworld. At the hands and imagination of production designer Ruth De Jong (Manchester by the Sea) the tunnels look like porcelain walls in a fancy spa lobby. The spaces off the halls look like poorly lit high school classrooms. Audiences expecting something dark and sinister like a decayed subway tunnel (e.g. the  L  line in New York City) won t find one.   The Wilsons are as all-American as the family on TV s Blackish, minus the biting humor. Racial issues are not brought up, it s not that kind of party. Lupita Nyong o is a vision as the two moms. Smooth skin, gorgeous lips. She s is earnest in a very complicated role, especially as Red the demon shadow. Winston Duke is amicable as the dad who has trouble defending his family. Duke plays the father like he s Jordan Peele s alter ego. Elisabeth Moss and Tim Heidecker as the heads of the Tyler household don t get a real chance to fly. The extras who play zombie-types in the tunnel couldn t frighten a flea.   A beach bum in Santa Cruz holds a sign that reads: Jeremiah 11:11. The verse proclaims:  Therefore, this is what the LORD says: I am going to bring calamity upon them, and they will not escape. Though they beg for mercy, I will not listen to their cries.    Us never reaches that over-the-edge crescendo into total mayhem that scares you to death and makes a good horror film a great one. "
DSP_Doc3_Us,"Writer-director Jordan Peele s debut feature  Get Out  was one of the most inventive horror movies in years, and so the expectations for his sophomore effort,  Us,  have been running sky-high. It too is a horror film with a light overlay of gallows humor, but it s a more ambitious work than  Get Out.  Despite some extraordinary sequences, it s also a lesser work.  The film opens in 1986 in an amusement park in the oceanside city of Santa Cruz, California. A young girl, Adelaide Wilson (Madeline Curry), wanders off from her parents and enters a seemingly deserted hall of mirrors where she encounters, to traumatizing effect, not only her own reflection but a doppelganger of herself.  Cut to the present day, and Adelaide (Lupita Nyong o) is living what appears to be a comfortably middle-class suburban life with her affable husband, Gabe (Winston Duke), and  two spunky children, Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Evan Alex). When Gabe proposes a summer vacation stayover in Santa Cruz, she balks at the bad memories but reluctantly goes along. Soon enough, bad stuff happens, leading to the film s first true explosion of horror: One night, outside the Wilsons  summer home, a family of red robe-wearing Wilson doppelgangers, clutching razor-sharp scissors, are silently massed in the driveway ready to attack.  As we soon see, the four actors are playing dual roles, themselves and their malevolent doubles. The home invasion is brutal, bloody, and unrelenting. Adelaide s double, who speaks in hoarse, spasmodic, guttural tones, is especially menacing. The murderousness continues as the Wilsons, seeking refuge in the nearby home of vacationing friends, played by Tim Heidecker and Elisabeth Moss, are aghast to discover that they also have been invaded by doppelgangers.  This is one of the few horror movies to feature an African-American family, and, especially given the racial-satirical slant of  Get Out,  we might expect the same slant here. However, Peele is going after bigger allegorical game. But what exactly is the allegory that Peele is pushing? In the 1986 prologue, he makes reference to the Hands Across America benefit event that was intended to raise millions for those who are hungry and homeless. The death-dealing doppelgangers in  Us,  who are soon proliferating everywhere, likewise hold hands. There are several references to a Bible passage in Jeremiah 11:11 with words  I will bring on them a disaster they cannot escape.  White rabbits turn up.  Instead of specifically targeting racial animosities, Peele seems to be going after the doubleness of a society in which everyone has their dark side they refuse to acknowledge. Speaking recently to an audience at the South By Southwest film festival, as reported in the Los Angeles Times, he said as much:  On the broader strokes of things, this movie is about this country. And when I decided to write this movie, I was stricken with the fact that we are in a time when we fear the other, whether it is the mysterious invader that we think is going to come and kill us, take our jobs, or the faction that we don t live near that voted a different way than us. We re all about pointing the finger. And I wanted to suggest that maybe the monster we really need to look at has our face.   The problem is, the movie is so chockablock with horror tropes and fright-night symbolism that it often comes across as nothing more than a smorgasbord of scare effects. There s a deeper problem: Peele may think he is slamming all factions for not facing the beast within, but the way he goes after the Wilsons here is especially punitive. Their middle-classness is used against them. He sets a squadron of monsters on them for, it would appear, nothing more flagrant than indulging in materialism and social media. Are we supposed to think that the Wilsons  privilege is won at the expense of the poor and the forgotten? As an allegory, not to mention as a social construct, how does the situation in  Us    as in  United States,  get it?   reflect this country? Ambition in the horror genre can be a good thing, but the overreach in this movie detracts from both the horror and the ambition.  Having said that, Peele shows a marked advance in filmmaking skills here and, in her dual role, Nyong o is ferociously good. Coming as it does after Toni Collette in  Hereditary  and Emily Blunt in  A Quiet Place,  her performance would appear to officially herald a golden age for full-scale performances in a long-derided genre.  Talented as he is, I hope that Peele, who also is behind TV s upcoming  Twilight Zone  reboot, doesn t seek to position himself as the new M. Night Shyamalan, complete with gotcha effects and trapdoor finales. His satiric-horrific take on society, which sporadically breaks through  Us,  is a rare gift. Rarer, perhaps, than he himself realizes."
DSP_Doc4_Us,"Writer-director Jordan Peele rose to fame as half of the comedy team Key and Peele and his breakout hit Get Out was as much satire as horror, not least in its clarity of purpose.  While the macabre underpinnings of the meet-the-parents premise took time to emerge, it was plain right away that Peele was making a statement about racism from an African-American perspective, mocking the hypocrisy of white liberals in particular.  Perhaps Peele wound up feeling Get Out was too neat and tidy for its own good   and too easily embraced by the very people he had set out to critique. His follow-up, Us, is similar in its allegorical approach, yet also a change of pace: murkier, harder to digest and less likely to be nominated for multiple Oscars.  Best to pause here if you don't want spoilers. The story follows an ordinary middle-class family   doofus dad Gabe (Winston Duke), high-strung mother Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o) plus children Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Evan Alex)   on holiday to Santa Cruz.  After dark, Gabe and Adelaide spy a second family of four lurking in their driveway, wearing baggy red jumpsuits and standing in a row with hands linked like living paper dolls.  Where these figures came from and why is a mystery, but their immediate, murderous aims are all too clear. The battle is on to survive through the night, with terror multiplying once it's discovered the newcomers are exact physical duplicates of their intended victims.  Dopplegangers, clones and shadow selves have been everywhere in popular culture for the past few years, yet Peele's use of the trope is initially puzzling. More is going on, evidently, than the stock suggestion that each of us has a hidden dark side.  For an unsettling few minutes it's possible to wonder if he's drawing on the worst kind of white supremacist fantasy for his own purposes, forcing the members of this black family to confront  themselves  as they might appear in the imagination of paranoid racists. But that doesn't seem to be it, quite, because Gabe and Adelaide's white friends Kitty and Josh (Elizabeth Moss and Tim Heidecker), who are staying nearby, turn out to have their own, equally vicious doubles.  If Us isn't about race in the clear-cut way that Get Out was, it also isn't not about race   especially since the mythology underlying the action proves to be centered on the concept of  tethering , a metaphor that all but explicitly harks back to the days of slavery.  In truth, Us strikes me as what scholars sometimes call an  incoherent text , at once over-specific and frustratingly vague. Clues are scattered throughout that ask us to look for some deep, hidden meaning   starting with the row of 1980s VHS tapes visible at the start of the film's prologue, from The Goonies to The Man With Two Brains.  Yet a good portion of the film functions in practice like the kind of stalk-and-slash thriller that has been made a zillion times before, often with more finesse.  Peele's main visual strategy is to place the camera slightly closer to the actors' faces than feels comfortable, while the wide-screen format leaves room for us to seek out suggestive details in the background. This is effective at points, but can easily feel clumsy and overbearing.  Likewise, the script shows little of the tonal control of Get Out. The touches of comic relief are often ill-judged, undermining whatever belief we might have in the reality of the story.  Not once but twice, the chief villain takes time out to deliver a lengthy monologue   less because this makes sense for the character than because Peele hasn't found a better way to explain what's going on.  And yet the film, for all its unevenness and confusion, cannot be dismissed. Something genuinely urgent seems to be happening, especially in the performances by Nyong'o and, to a lesser extent, Moss (whose role in The Handmaid's Tale is yet another reference point)  That there's room for more than one interpretation is no bad thing in itself. The notion of a long-suppressed force rising up from below might well resonate with many types of audiences, however they understand it and whether they welcome or fear the unrest to come."
DSP_Doc5_Us,"Get Out was one of the most talked-about and commonly dissected horror films of the decade and it thrust first-time director Jordan Peele firmly into the spotlight. Now, two years later, Peel has answered the  what s next?  question with Us, an uneven film that calls to mind a common pitfall in the movie industry often referred to as the Sophomore Slump. Despite an intriguing premise and a single great sequence, Us is a muddled affair that goes off the rails the more Peele tries to expand, explore, and explain his basic concept. It s often said that less is more in horror and, had Peele cut out a lion s share of the exposition in Us, it would have made for a more viscerally satisfying experience.  Following a creepy prologue set in a Santa Cruz amusement park circa 1986, Us jumps forward in time to  today.  A family of four   father Gabe (Winston Duke), mother Adelaide (Lupita Nyong o), daughter Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph), and son Jason (Evan Alex)   are about to embark on the annual ritual of a summer vacation at the lake. Most of Us  first half-hour is devoted to establishing how normal the Wilsons are. When they arrive at the lake house, Zora complains that she can t get on-line. Gabe buys a cheap boat. Us gets the family-bonding details right; however, this being a horror film, as night follows day, so unpleasantness trails normalcy.  It begins during a power outage with a creepy quartet standing mutely at the end of the driveway, their intentions as hidden by darkness as their countenances. Adelaide is immediately worried but Gabe is more laid-back in his approach. However, when the strangers don t respond to his friendly challenges, he tells his wife to call the police and returns outside brandishing a bat. That s when the home invasion begins   a terrifically crafted 15-minute sequence in which intercutting shows the fate of each member of the Wilson family as the situation unfolds. There s some exposition included here as well   an explanation of why the invaders resemble the victims. They are the  shadows  and they have come with the intention of untethering themselves from their hosts. That can be accomplished only by using scissors. Peele makes sure we don t miss the haves-and-have-nots message here by hammering it home with little attempt at subtlety.  What are you?  asks the affluent black woman of her downtrodden shadow.  We re Americans,  she responds.  The creepiness factor alone keeps the first half of Us involving. Then things start going bonkers and not in a good way. Although never as whacked out as mother!, Us trends in that direction with some plot twists/developments that don t make sense. Logic be damned, however   this movie has metaphors. It s saying something. To make matters worse, Peele doesn t stick to the rules he establishes. After making it clear that the  shadows  are human, he violates that tenet almost immediately. Us embraces horror movie clich s (like the dead not staying dead and supposedly intelligent people doing stupid things) with glee   at times, this seems to be done tongue-in-cheek but not always. There s a fair amount of wit and humor (most of which is intentional) in the proceedings but, outside of the home invasion sequence, there s not enough tension or suspense. Whereas Get Out made viewers feel uncomfortable, the only discomfort emerging from Us is the realization of how little sense everything makes. Putting aside one feeble jump-scare, Peele doesn t seem interested or invested in frightening viewers. He s too busy preaching.  As was the case with Get Out, Peele has stayed away from Big Name Actors in casting Us. Instead, he has reached into the MCU and plucked out Oscar-winner Lupita Nyong o and Winston Duke, both of whom appeared in Black Panther. They re very good here with Nyong o focused on her character s emotional turmoil and Duke providing a portion of the film s comedic relief (along with a few one-liners that come out of the Schwarzenegger school of instant quotables). Shahadi Wright Joseph and Evan Alex, who represent the next generation, get their opportunities to wreak havoc.  If there s one thing that saves Us, it s that, even as the movie descends into a narrative morass from which it never escapes, there are many individual scenes that, taken in isolation, pack a punch. The problem is that, once assembled into the larger whole, it doesn t all work. One would have to be forgiving in the extreme to give Peele a pass by using the justification that all horror films are preposterous. Yes, many are, but not this nonsensical. Us is audacious, to be sure, but audacity isn t always a good thing."
DSP_Doc6_Us,"After seeing Jordan Peele s new horror film, Us, I wondered if the director had created it as a warning to himself to resist the siren comforts of wealth, fame and his own id after the smashing reception he received for last year s Get Out. Forget the voiceless and pay the price, Us seems to be croaking at its audience.  Allow me to explain: Us is about a middle-class black family, the Wilsons, who go on vacation to California only to find themselves at the center of a revenge plot 30 years in the making. The father, Gabe (Winston Duke), is a big, corny teddy bear of a man who is overcome by an almost pathological need to keep up with the family frenemies, the Tylers. The Tylers, who are white, have a nicer car, a bigger boat and a more modern, better-equipped vacation house. Gabe, much to the chagrin of his wife, Adelaide (Lupita Nyong o), wants to go to the beach to hang out with Josh Tyler (Tim Heidecker) and compare boat notes. Adelaide wants to stay home and read instead of making small talk while Kitty Tyler (Elisabeth Moss) sips her mommy juice. It turns out Adelaide s nervousness is about way more than hanging out with a bickering white couple and their bratty twin daughters.  The Wilsons are soon visited by a family that is a twisted mirror of their own: a husband, a wife and two children, all clad in red jumpsuits and tan leather driving gloves on their right hands. Each of them is equipped with sharp brass shears that are useful for stabbing people and cutting the heads off of rabbits.  It turns out everyone, including the Tylers, have these red-clad doppelg ngers, who refer to themselves as  shadows.  The shadows live underground, tethered to the whims of their sun-basking counterparts. They are a permaclass of the unseen, unheard and unacknowledged, and none of them has the ability to speak   except Red, who communicates with a creaking, disturbed hollowness, as if an animal had chewed halfway through her vocal cords. When Adelaide enjoys a Christmas of gifts, merriment and a hearty dinner, her shadow is forced to dine on raw rabbit. When Adelaide gets married, has sex and gives birth to two children, so too does Red. The shadows are crude copies of humans who experience pain, torture, madness and imprisonment from all the things that give their doubles pleasure.  Sick of their fate, the shadows emerge to conduct a massive, blood-soaked untethering. There are harbingers of disaster everywhere in the film that all point to the same Bible verse, Jeremiah 11:11:  Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them.   Us is a jagged allegory for the pitfalls of capitalism and the resentment that mounts when we pretend those whose labor we exploit for our happiness do not exist. As social commentary, it s not as razor-sharp as Get Out. But it still feels like an exceptional accomplishment, mainly because Peele created a role that is a worthy showcase of Nyong o s talent. In Us, Nyong o is the unforgettable two-faced queen come to warn us of what will happen when we keep our own brethren out of sight and out of mind. She makes Red s movements just as studied, precise and creepy as her voice. It is a virtuosic performance and wickedly fun. You get the sense that Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?-era Bette Davis would hate Nyong o if she were her awards season competition, before perhaps warming to her with grudging respect.  Peele has been explicit that Us is not a film about race, and yet it pulls off something that feels transcendent, both because of the unstudied blackness of its cast and because of Peele s commitment to smartening up a genre typically defined by gore, monsters, cheap scares, or all of the above. In the history of the Oscars, only six horror films (The Exorcist, Jaws, Black Swan, The Silence of the Lambs, The Sixth Sense and Get Out) have been nominated for best picture.  In both Get Out and Us, Peele builds on a tradition of black horror as social commentary and pushback against white stereotypes of blackness that extends as far back as Duane Jones  turn as Ben in Night of the Living Dead (1968). Ben, who is actually the hero of the film, ends up getting shot and tossed on a funeral pyre when white rescuers assume he s an enemy. This, after he s spent the movie saving a bunch of white people from marauding ghouls looking to eat live flesh.  Peele delights in playing with tropes and subverting them. In Get Out, the black protagonist actually gets to live. In Us, the white family is deemed inessential to the plot and gets offed by the second act. In Us, the clue to Adelaide s status as a misfit lay in her inability to snap on beat to a rapper s ode to the communal consumption of a dimebag. Later in the movie, that same song gets reinvented with heavy, spooky, sonorous strings, courtesy of composer Michael Abels, who also scored Get Out. He simultaneously celebrates the genre and critiques it. Peele offers something for everyone: winks and Easter eggs for fanboys who consume movies as though they re video games to be figured out, highbrow allegory for those who need more than an imaginary monster to keep them up at night, and now a fantastically twisted antihero played by an Academy Award-winning queen.  Furthermore, he broadens appreciation for the genre. Peele managed to get Oprah Winfrey (who is on record as someone who avoids scary movies) and plenty of others who are horror-averse to not only sit through Get Out but marvel at it and then see it again. He ll likely accomplish something similar with Us. Both are too zeitgeisty to miss.  In the context of horror history, in which films such as King Kong, The Spider and The Creature from the Black Lagoon used monsters as stand-ins for black people, Peele s success feels like a multilayered triumph. It wasn t that long ago that a thoughtful horror film by a black director was pooh-poohed by studio executives for being too ambitious. When Bill Gunn released Ganja & Hess in 1973, in which the need for blood functioned as a metaphor for drug addiction, it was a hit at the Cannes Film Festival. But American film executives were so turned off that it was recut and released as the hackneyed Blood Couple. If you wanted to see Ganja & Hess, it was nearly impossible. The Museum of Modern Art possesses the print.  Almost 50 years later, Peele is getting the recognition that bypassed directors such as Gunn, and he is slashing his own path through Hollywood with remakes of The Twilight Zone and Candyman. He s said repeatedly that Us is about how we are our own worst enemies. Maybe Peele is also thinking about how to avoid becoming his."
DSP_Doc7_Us,"Expectations for Peele s follow-up were skewed accordingly. Yet any rumours that his sophomore outing, Us, is  just  a straight-ahead scare-fest seem exaggerated. Although it is foremost a highly entertaining and well-executed horror movie, Us is shot through with its own strain of social criticism. Here the subject is not race, but class, with the film introducing an underworld of voiceless doppelgangers armed with lethal scissors and clad in blood-red onesies that recall, all at once, prison uniforms, working class coveralls and, yes, Delirious-era Murphy.  The film opens on the Santa Cruz boardwalk circa 1986, where a father wins a prize (a baggy Thriller T-shirt, no less   here Peele lucks into his zeitgeistiness) for his young daughter. Ignored by her quarrelling parents, the child ambles into a hall of mirrors, where she meets another a girl, who appears to be her exact double. Cut to 30 years later, and the girl is now a married mother of two played by Lupita Nyong o, back in sunny Santa Cruz for a beach holiday with her own family. In a film abounding with imagery of doubles, mirrors, rhymes and reflections, it should be no surprise that history repeats itself, with Nyong o s young son wandering near the same carnival attraction, and baiting a clan of (almost) exact doubles of his entire family back to their beach house.  From here, Peele develops a genuinely thrilling, heart-in-the-throat-scary horror picture. The archly creepy doubles   called  the Tethered,  after the manner in which they are existentially bound to their above-ground versions, like shadows   are a monster worthy of the Universal logo that precedes the film s opening titles. Peele exhibits a mastery of his camera, of managing suspense, and of teasing (and rewarding) the intimation of violence. He s also an exceptionally talented director of actors. Nyong o s physicality in her dual role as both herself and her Tether is revelatory. (Also excellent: Winston Duke as her husband, whose manner suggests a burlier on-screen surrogate for Peele himself; and Tim Heidecker and Elisabeth Moss as their gaucher, more garishly wealthy friends.)  Nyong o s physicality in her dual role as both herself and her Tether is revelatory.  Peele possesses a distinct talent for handling horror and comedy simultaneously, such that jokes landing in the midst of sustained suspense and wanton violence feel both natural and cathartic. There are multiple scenes in which pitched screams descend into fits of laughter, which feels like as fine a trademark for writer/director/producer Peele as his recurring image of a single tear dripping down a face seized by abject terror.  Strangely, this sophomore effort feels like more of a proverbial  calling card picture  than Get Out. It s as if Peele, rattled by his own hype, is straining to show what he can do as a straight-ahead craftsman, absent all the talk of him being a generational talent with a gift for articulating the issues vexing America. The film s critique of classism   present not only in the central family s war against the Tethered, but their hostility toward Heidecker and Moss s family, with their Botox and smart-home and more souped-up holiday boat rental   is undercooked. In Get Out, the terror, the comedy, and the commentary all felt as if they were producing one another. With Us, it s as if Peele is struggling to find a contemporary issue onto which he can overlay his horror movie. (You can t spell  Us  without  U.S.,  and so on.)  Add to this the film s belaboured mise-en-sc ne, which telescopes its themes without anything in the way of subtlety. An opening sequence depicting an 80s-vintage home entertainment console adorned with VHS tapes of C.H.U.D., The Goonies, A Nightmare on Elm Street, and The Man With Two Brains (in which Steve Martin is telepathically linked with a separate brain), serve to twitchily wink at the film s notion of a bifurcated underworld/overworld structure. Such touches might dazzle in their initial density and deliberateness, but they re unlikely to generate much in the way of analysis outside of dopey  20 Things You Might Have Missed In Us  YouTube videos.  These are not the markers of a bad film   or a bad filmmaker   by any stretch. But where Get Out felt urgent and preternaturally confident, Us is the work of a gifted director who seems to be compensating for having less to say by overstating how he says it. Peele knows his horror movie canon well enough to realize that the best cheapo fright flicks are not only scary and fun, but shaggy enough to invite interpretation, instead of issuing preachy messaging about The State Of The World Today.  In place of the hushed voices of his debut (or of Murphy s inciting Delirious joke), you can almost hear Peele goading his audience with Us. It s less  get out  and more  get it? "
DSP_Doc8_Us,"If Get Out wasn t scary enough for you, then Jordan Peele really wants to freak you out with Us.  Us is much more of a conventional horror movie, designed to make you jump in your seat, hold your breath for too long and stare down at your lap to hide from the terrors on screen.  In other words, it s more sensory experience than think-piece.  If Get Out fills us with an existential dread, Us fills us with just your regular kind of dread. The kind of dread that comes from having a lumbering red jumpsuit-decked version of yourself chase you down with some mighty sharp scissors.  Who needs a Ghostface Killer mask when the face the monster wears is the scariest one of all? Yours.  Simply structured in three acts, Us s cold open begins in the mid-80s. A young Adelaide (Madison Curry) is separated from her feuding parents on the Santa Cruz boardwalk.  Wearing a Michael Jackson  Thriller  T-shirt, Adelaide wanders into a deserted funhouse and becomes trapped in the mirror room when the power goes out.  What she sees in the maze of mirrors haunts her to the point that when as an adult (Lupita Nyong o), Adelaide is still deeply uncomfortable when she and her family   husband Gabe Wilson (Winston Duke), daughter Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and son Jason (Evan Alex)   return to the beach during their summer holidays.  Sitting on the beach with their friends Kitty (Elisabeth Moss) and Josh (Tim Heidecker) and their twins (Cali Sheldon and Noelle Sheldon), Adelaide warns they must leave the beach before dark.  That night, back at their holiday house, a family that looks exactly like them, their malevolent doppelgangers, attacks the Wilsons.  The middle act of Us is the most effective, a classic home invasion slasher horror, except when the enemy is a twisted version of yourself, it cuts, literally, that much closer.  Here, Peele s prodigious skill as a director is on full display. These sequences are taut, tense and breathtakingly good.  Even when you re scared, you can t help but notice Peele s striking visuals   they really are beautiful to look at   whether it s the Wilsons walking in a row at the beach, stalked by their shadows on the sand, or a particularly vexing sequence in the final act that we wouldn t dare give away.  Peele is also a master of tone, balancing the horror with comedy, just like he did in Get Out. That is not an easy thing to master, and no one is doing it better than the former one-half of sketch duo Key & Peele.  Honestly, if you ve never seen Winston Duke on a boat before, you re missing out. Or, Elisabeth Moss with a lip gloss tube.  The four leads are crazy good in their dual roles, especially Nyong o who manages to create distinct but connected personalities between Adelaide and her doppelganger Red who skitters around like a cockroach.  The words  Oscar nomination  and  Nyong o  is being thrown about and it s not without merit.  Us is littered with  coincidences  and doubles as a constant reminder there s much more at play than the chase.  Peele has said Us is supposed to question  the fear of the other  and whether the real monsters are ourselves. It s like the funhouse mirrors at the beginning of the film, a potent visual symbol of our own self-image reflected but usually willfully ignored   distorted and grotesque.  Also layered into the movie are thoughts on social inequality, the haves and have-nots and the politics of envy.  The Wilsons are a comfortable, middle class African-American family, but they re not as well-off as their friends Kitty and Josh. At one point, Gabe looks on at Josh s new car with a tinge of green.  But their doppelgangers, called  the tethered , are stratified well below the Wilsons, so it s like we re stuck in this perpetual cycle of consumerism and want. Everyone wants something someone else has and that s part of the reckoning in Us.  The social commentary in Us is not as clear as Get Out, which had one strong central idea it ran with all the way through.  In Us, there are several ideas at play, and it doesn t always form a coherent whole   and the ending may turn everything on its head anyway.  Us is a movie you need to sit with for a while because your feelings and thoughts on it will morph with time and every subsequent conversation.  But it is indeed a worthy follow-up to Get Out, proof that Peele isn t a one-tricker, that he s capable of evolving his creativity and, most importantly, that he can give you one hell of an entertaining and thrilling ride."
DSP_Doc9_Us,"Jordan Peele defines his Oscar-winning film, Get Out, as a  social thriller,  and the first of five genre films he plans to make, telling Business Insider,  I ve been working on these premises about these different social demons, these innately human monsters that are woven into the fabric of how we think and how we interact, and each one of my movies is going to be about a different one of these social demons.  Exploiting more jump scares, action, and violence than Get Out, Us effectively expands on the previous film both generically and thematically, combining the zombie, apocalypse, and home-invasion subgenres to produce a socially conscious horror film.  Like many of the most enduring horror films, Peele taps into the return of the repressed. Us dares us to contemplate what lies beneath the  Find Yourself  hall of mirrors (literally represented by a beachside carnival attraction), both psychologically and spatially leading down a rabbit hole of possible interpretations. In the depths below the earth, Peele reveals a prison-like laboratory/dormitory, rendering a space that might be a national  sunken place  the hypnotized state that the protagonist of Get Out fears being sent into, in which the black body is paralyzed, expropriated, and stripped of agency while retaining a frightening consciousness of imprisonment. Us signals its intentions, and possibly a key influence, early on. Overhead shots reminiscent of Kubrick s The Shining introduce the Wilson family before the camera drops down to an image of togetherness: that ubiquitous decal of a stick-figure smiley-face nuclear family on their rear windshield. These figures, hand-in-hand, become a potent symbol in the film, representing much more than just the Wilsons.  We first encounter the family cruising through the mountains, blasting old-school rap ( I Got 5 on It ), heading to Santa Cruz for an annual beach vacation. Howard University grad dad Gabe (Winston Duke) whose glasses make him look like director Jordan Peele, and who is much more of a teddy bear here than as the intimidating M Baku in Black Panther is behind the wheel, surrounded by mother Adelaide (Lupita Nyong o), irritable teenager Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph), and slightly weird but sweetly vulnerable son, Jason (Evan Alex). The Wilsons arrive and meet up with friends and boozy neighbors Josh and Kitty Tyler (Tim Heidecker and Elisabeth Moss) and their mean-girl twin teens and, though the Tylers  new boat opens up a friendly economic rivalry, all signs indicate clear sailing ahead. Adelaide, however, has been haunted by a series of foreboding premonitions, which are soon validated. Later that evening, the power fails, and a family of eerie doppelg ngers, clad in red coveralls, suddenly appears at the Wilsons  vacation house.  Us turns out to be filled with doubles and twins, a gothic perennial of the uncanny that Peele taps into. The double has a long history on screen, with classics indebted to the trope s disquieting powers including not only The Shining and its twins but Vertigo as well. But mirroring is not the only tool that Peele employs to elicit chills in a movie dotted with allusions to both social and film history. The accumulation of carefully placed details, dialogue clues, and cultural references a Black Flag T-shirt nods toward rebellion and anarchy, a set of handcuffs not-so-discreetly toward slavery drives the narrative and provides viewers with pieces to puzzle over long after the lights come up. For horror aficionados, the golf club used as a weapon might bring to mind Michael Haneke s disturbing Funny Games, and a shot of black gloves may evoke a giallo predator. Scissors, a prominent motif in the film s advertising campaign, are a tried-and-true emblem of the genre (and another nod to doubling). Despite the allusions, the film is Peele s own intricately woven, thoughtfully layered, and terrifyingly fun to watch. God as evoked in Jeremiah 11:11, quoted in the movie is in the details.  There is another doubling at work between the genre twins of horror and the musical. Both require a suspension of disbelief and make narrative use of music and choreography. Music and dance are put to dazzling use during the film s climax, in which Nyong o performs a balletic Odette/Odile dance of violence and pursuit of self. All of the actors are terrific and are clearly relishing the challenge of articulating nuances of characterization as they transform over the course of the film into the doubles, who in turn stand in for us, the audience. Newcomer Madison Curry as young Adelaide is, in particular, a standout Peele s highlighting of girls and women as leaders instead of victims is bracing. Considering the nuances of enacting multiple selves made me wonder: are black actors, already burdened by a DuBoisian double consciousness, more versed in portraying layers of characterizations?  Us features beautiful cinematography by Mike Gioulakis, whose credits include the viral (in all the wrong ways) chiller It Follows, and who photographs black skin in rich and scary chiaroscuro, delineating the  real  characters from their doubles. The editing by Nicholas Monsour (a veteran of Key and Peele as well as the goofy gangsta kitten comedy Keanu) is a tour de force, and all the elements of the production work together to create an atmospheric menace that occupies a breathless two-thirds of the high-intensity 116-minute running time. Fortunately, regular doses of humor prevent the pace from becoming overwhelming.  The beginning of the film cryptically references the bizarre 1986 pre social media campaign Hands Across America, in which 6.5 million (North) Americans linked hands, from California to New York City, in a branded and symbolic effort to fight poverty and homelessness. The  80s were a frightening time in many ways, as the long hangover from the  60s gave way to Reagan s reactionary politics, the Chernobyl disaster, the Iran-Contra scandal, and the Christian Coalition. (Possibly in response, the era was also a heyday for the slasher flick.) In Us, that not-so-distant past is prologue, and the echoing image of paper dolls, hand in hand, becomes a major motif and a potent symbol of spatial, generational, and national trauma. Ultimately, the return of the repressed which Peele s film points to lies in the legacies of failed and facile social programs, passed down through the years the underlying horror haunting both the family in Us, and the U.S."
DSP_Doc10_Us,"As a fan of Jordan Peele's comedy work before Get Out made him into a household name as a director, I was very excited see him continue to explore social politics through horror in Us (2019). And Us (2019) is so much more complex and energetic then his last movie that only came out two years ago, that I had to watch this movie two times before giving my complete thoughts.

On the surface Us (2019) paints a very straightforward survival horror premise of a family called the Wilsons forced to fight against homicidal versions of themselves called the Tethered. But Peele doesn't rely on the gimmick of the killer or monster being our copies to hold it together. He merely uses it as an opportunity to go deeper into very questionable and existential ideas about human identity.

A large part of what holds Us together is Lupita Nyong'o dual performances as Adelaide and Red. When we first meet Adelaide she is this paranoid mother worried about her family's safety and is driven to extreme lengths to keep them safe from her Tether copy Red. And with Nyongo playing Red as well, she makes every single uncanny bodily movement and every word from her rasping voice to feel both terrifying the as film's villain but also evoke the harsh reality she comes from. But as the story evolves, Nyong'o brings more dimensions to both her characters that go beyond the final girl and slasher villain in a horror film. Adelaide becomes more assertive and aggressive in her actions and we then see the tragedy that Red has been carrying for decades that acts as fuel for her violent revolution. It's a difficult challenge for someone to bring this much depth to two characters in one movie but Nyongo's deserves as many awards as possible for achieving it.

Now that Peele's gets to play with a larger scope, we see that he gets to have more fun within horror and comedy. While Get Out was a slow burn to the horror's reveal, Us immediately sets it in motion within the first 30 minutes. The sequence of the Tether breaking into the Wilson's home is probably one of the scariest sequences I have seen in recent years. From there the movie never slows down to make you feel like the Wilsons are safe from this threat. But the horror never becomes overwhelming thanks to Peele's expertise in comedy to be used in the right moments. A lot of it comes from how well the humour is written within the characters themselves from Winston Duke's surprisingly hysterical portrayal of an ignorant nerdy dad and husband to the son played in a breakout performance by Alex Jones unintentionally being self-aware of the crazy situation they are in.

While Get Out made it very clear from the start it was about racism, Us plays it more subtly with its social messaging. Using the creepy imaginary of mirroring and contrasting visuals and sequences of repetition (just like last year's The Favourite it make flocks of rabbits evoke dread), it not only foreshadows the darkness that is to come but also reinforce the themes of dual identities. And examining closely through certain lines of dialogue and scenes, Peele is very much making a commentary on America's economy and class-system. Through the Wilson's middle-class perspective of what to them seems like twisted versions of themselves invading their home, Us reveals the misguided views society has on those that lack the upper-class's benefits and awards. And when the Wilsons are forced to breakaway from their carefree identities in order live; it only proves they can be just as savage as their own Tethers. Particularly reflecting on the refuge crisis happening today during the Trump administration, Adelaide and Red's conflict becomes less about the duality between good and evil and more about whom deserves the better life and what is it worth to gain and keep that life.

Easily the best movie this year so far and is defiantly made be to watched more then once."
