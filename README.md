The purpose is to examine how these various methods categorize documents into distinct categories such as positive/negative reviews, genres, movie titles, or previously unconsidered classifications.

Firstly, we derive several insights from 200 movie reviews corpus-wide vocabulary using Natural Language Programming (NLP) approaches such as data wrangling with document vectorization techniques such as Stemming, Lemmatization, and stop word techniques are used to reduce words to their base or root form also remove are common words that don't add much meaning to the text which helps to reduce the noise in the analysis. TF-IDF(Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): This is a numerical representation of a word's importance in a document relative to a collection of documents. Word embeddings to learn words that have different meanings, capturing semantic relationships

After vectorization, we evaluated the corpus using the following NLP techniques such as k-means clustering, Latent Semantic Analysis (LDA), Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and classification models such as Na√Øve Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest
